# COSC457 PROJECT
The final build of my Spring 2023 COSC 457 project. This project involved creating a working database and GUI for a company of our choosing. For this project, our group decided to go with Ourisman Automotive. After recieving a signature from one of their IT employees, our group got to work to build an inventory system that can be edited and filtered at any notice, to help keep track of warehouse storage. Due to github accessibility restraints, the project ended up being shared via google drive. Therefore, only the final build has been posted to github.

This project was build using Java and Netbeans. Due to time constraints, a lot of code is unoptimized. If given the extra chance/time, I would have loved to go through and refactor some of the code. If the chance permits, I may return to re-optimize the code.
